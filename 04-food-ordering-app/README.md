### Q1. Is JSX mandatory for React?

Actually, no, we don't necessarilly need to use JSX in React. We can use React.createElement() istead. But createElement() is repetitive and creates a mess in the code base. That's why we use JSX as it is more like HTML markups, it is easier to use, read and debug.

### Q2. Is ES6 mandatory for React?

ES6 or ECMAScript 6 is a JS update where a lot of new feature came to JavaScript in 2015. It makes easy to write code in JS as it launches new features like Arrow Functions, new loops (map, filter, reduce), destructing and spreading etc.

In react it is easier to use ES6 concepts as is short and quick to read. So using ES6 in React appears helpful.

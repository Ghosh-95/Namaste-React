### Q1. What is Emmet?
<p> Emmet is a tool that helps developers to write and expnad shorthand HTML and other languages. It's desigined to write code faster by providing multiple shortcuts and abbreviation that can be expanded into piece of codes.</p>

<p>We can use emmet by adding to the IDE we use everyday. Emmet provides a wide range of code-snippets that help developers in the field of web development</p>

### Q2. What are the difference between a Library and a Framework?

<p>Both libraries and frameworks are reusable piece of code that is written by others. And they are widely used to solve orginary problems easily.</p>

- **Frameworks** supply a blueprint of a finished product. As a result, a framework gives the fundamental structure while indicating the customization developer might require. A framework defines the workflow of a software application. Apart from that, a framwork can reduces code length, enable code reuse, ease debugging and improve security. 
    >E.g. DJango, Express, Angular
- A **Library**, on the other hand, is a group or pre-written codes to ease development. A collection of pre-defined methods and classes that developer can use to accelerate their development process. As a result, a developer do not need to write code to achieve certain features. Most programming languages has their own standard libraries, but developers can make their own library. As a software engineer, one can leverage libraries during a typical development process. Libraries proved reusable code-components, predefined functions and important constants that can be used to simplify and fastforward development process.
    >E.g React, Redux, jQuery

### Q3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
 p<>A Content Delivery Network is a geographically distributed group of server that enables caching the content close to clients. A CDN allows their quick transfer of assets needed for loading a webpage content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images and videos.</p>
 
 * Today majority of web traffic is served through CDNs, including traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon.
 * Improves website laod times so that visitor can experience smooth surfing and thus they spend more time on the site.
 * Reduces bandwidth costs by caching and other organizatioins, CDNs are able to reduce the amount of data an origin server must provide. Thus reducing the cost of website owners.
 * A CDN might improve website security by doing impletetions to security certificates, preventing `DDoS`(Distributed denial-of-service) attacks through mitigation and other optimizations.

 ### Q4. Why is React known as React?

 React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook. Developers use it to build interactive user interfaces for websites and web apps. With react, developers can create, combine and reuse components to makes beautiful, interactive webpages.

React is 'React' because: 
>- It 'reacts' quickly to changes without reloading the whole webpage.
>- It uses `virtual DOM` to efficiently updae parts of an webpage.
>- It's built around components that 'reacts' and update.

### Q5. What is crossorigin in script tag?

`crossorigin` HTML attribute sets the mode of the request to and HTTPS `CORS` request.

`CORS`: CORS is to manage cross-origin requests. It stands for `Cross Origin Resource Sharing`, a mechanism that allows a page to request resources from another domains outside of its own. I defines a way of how a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. CORS allows servers to specify who can access the assets on the server among other things.

A cross-origin request request is a request for a resource e.g. stylesheets, iFrames, images, fonts or scripts from another domain.

>*Opposite of cross-origin request is same-origin request, that determines interactions of resources remains within the same domain*.
